# Run the Sysop UI dev server with hot reload. Proxies /api to the Go
# server on :8093 — run `make run` in another shell. The dev UI is served
# under /sysop/ (see `base` in frontend/vite.config.ts).

# Build plugin binaries

# `make ui-build` first for a binary that serves the real UI.

# Build and run the server.
run: build

# Build the embedded UI and install the binary to $GOBIN — a self-contained
# tachyon on PATH that serves the real Sysop UI. Depends on build-plugins too:
# Cerberus's deploy runs `make build` then `make install`, and the plugin
# binary (spawned by path at runtime, not embedded) needs to ride along on
# that same deploy or it silently goes stale.

# Remove build artifacts. Keeps internal/webui/dist/.gitkeep so the
